acquisition_policy.py — Adaptive data acquisition controller [v2.3.0]

This is the control system that decides WHAT REALITY TO ASK FOR NEXT.

It is NOT a data merger. It is an epistemic budget optimizer that allocates
finite labeling resources across three ORTHOGONAL failure manifolds:

  1. UNCERTAINTY POLICY (boundary exploration)
     - Selects: high entropy / boundary samples
     - Fixes: decision boundary fuzziness
     - Signal: 1 - uncertainty_score (rank-normalized)
     - Proven: ~3-10x label efficiency vs random

  2. BLIND-SPOT POLICY (overconfidence exposure)
     - Selects: high kappa x gap_norm (structurally unstable confidence)
     - Fixes: calibration tail failures, confident false negatives
     - Signal: kappa_v4 x |S_v4 - S_v1| / max(S_v4, eps)
     - Proven: orthogonal to risk_score (rho=+0.23), AUC=0.57

  3. COST POLICY (impact prioritization)
     - Selects: high-impact / high-consequence domains
     - Fixes: real-world relevance weighting
     - Signal: failure_mode severity x is_high_impact

Architecture (v2.3.0):
  - Channel-forced allocation: each policy gets guaranteed slots
  - Adaptive weighting: alpha/beta/gamma evolve based on realized outcomes
  - Closed loop: label -> retrain -> measure per-channel efficiency -> rebalance

Combined acquisition function:
    score = alpha * uncertainty_norm + beta * blind_spot_norm + gamma * cost_norm

Adaptive weight update:
    After each retrain cycle, measure per-channel label efficiency:
        efficiency(channel) = (fraction of labels that were is_wrong=1) / (budget allocated)
    Then: weight_new(channel) = weight_old * (1 + efficiency_gain)
    Normalized to sum to 1.0.

This ensures:
    - Channels that find more real failures get more budget next cycle
    - No channel can be reduced below MIN_WEIGHT (exploration floor)
    - System self-corrects if one channel becomes saturated

Outputs:
    logs/acquisition_queue.jsonl       - definitive "label this next" list
    logs/acquisition_budget.json       - budget allocation + adaptive weights
    logs/channel_performance.jsonl     - per-channel outcome tracking

Usage:
    python scripts/acquisition_policy.py                # compute full queue
    python scripts/acquisition_policy.py --budget 50     # allocate 50 labels
    python scripts/acquisition_policy.py --show 20       # show top 20
    python scripts/acquisition_policy.py --update-weights # adaptive reweight
